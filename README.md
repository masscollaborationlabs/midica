Midica is an interpreter for a Music Programming Language.
It translates source code to MIDI.

But it can also be used as a MIDI Player, MIDI compiler or decompiler, Karaoke Player, ALDA Player,
ABC Player, LilyPond Player or a MIDI File Analyzer.

You write music with one of the supported languages (MidicaPL, ALDA or ABC).  

The built-in music programming language MidicaPL supports the same techniques as regular programming languages, like:

- Variables and Constants
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditions (if/elsif/else)
- Including Libraries
- Code Comments

You write your songs in plain text files using the text editor of your choice. Midica converts these files into MIDI or plays them directly.

# Get started
1. Install Java Runtume Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or higher.
2. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/truj/midica/releases/latest) and download the file `midica.jar`.
3. Start Midica using the command: `java -jar midica.jar`
4. Download one of the [example files](examples/) or create your own file and save it with the file extension `.midica`.
5. In the Midica application, load this file by pressing the upper right button `select file`.
6. Switch to the MidicaPL tab (it's the default tab) and choose this file.
7. Press the button `Start Player` and play the sequence

If you prefer to write your music in ALDA or ABC, you need to:

- Install [ALDA](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) or [abcMIDI](https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html)
- In Step 4: Download an [ALDA example](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/tree/master/examples) or [ABC example](https://abcnotation.com/search) or create your own file with the extension `.alda` or `.abc`.
- In Step 6: Switch to the ALDA or ABC tab (and maybe adjust the program path).

# Screenshots

You can find a lot of screenshots here: http://www.midica.org/screenshots.html

I will not repeat them all in this Readme. But at least here are three screenshots.
The first one shows the main window.
The second one shows the player in default mode.
The third one shows the player in Karaoke mode.

# Programming with Midica

Midica has its own Music Programming Language: MidicaPL. But alternatively you can also code in ALDA or ABC.

For learning, each language has its own resources:

- [MidicaPL tutorial](http://www.midica.org/tutorial.html)
- [ALDA documentation](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/blob/master/doc/index.md)
- [ABC tutorials](https://abcnotation.com/learn)

Here we focus on MidicaPL. For a quick reference, here are the links to the main
chapters of the MidicaPL tutorial:

- [Preparation](http://www.midica.org/tutorial.html)
- [Chapter 1: Basics](http://www.midica.org/tutorial-1.html)
- [Chapter 2: Improving](http://www.midica.org/tutorial-2.html)
- [Chapter 3: Functions](http://www.midica.org/tutorial-3.html)
- [Chapter 4: Blocks](http://www.midica.org/tutorial-4.html)
- [Chapter 5: Tweaking](http://www.midica.org/tutorial-5.html)
- [Chapter 6: Patterns](http://www.midica.org/tutorial-6.html)

Examples of complete songs can be found in the [examples directory](examples/).
In this Readme we just show some short examples to get an impression of the language.

## Example 1

This example only uses simple channel commands and lyrics:

	// use Piano in channel 0
	INSTRUMENTS
		0  ACOUSTIC_GRAND_PIANO  Piano
	END
	
	0  c  /8.  v=95, l=Hap   // v = velocity, 95 = forte
	0  c  /16        l=py_   // l = lyrics (syllable)
	
	0  d  /4   l=birth
	0  c  /4   l=day_        // '_' = space
	0  f  /4   l=to_
	
	0  e  /2   l=you\c\r     // \c = comma, \r = new line
	0  c  /8.  l=hap
	0  c  /16  l=py_
	
	0  d  /4   l=birth
	0  c  /4   l=day_
	0  g  /4   l=to_
	
	0  f  /2   l=you.\n      // \n = new paragraph
	0  c  /8.  l=Hap
	0  c  /16  l=py...

This results in a MIDI sequence like this:

<img src="img/example-birthday.svg" title="Example Score">

## Example 2

This example uses nestable blocks and global commands:

	// initialize channel 0 and 1
	INSTRUMENTS
	    0  ACOUSTIC_GRAND_PIANO  Piano (Right Hand)
	    1  ACOUSTIC_GRAND_PIANO  Piano (Left Hand)
	END
	
	*  key    d/min            // key signature
	*  time   3/4              // time signature
	*  tempo  170              // tempo in beats per minute
	
	{ q=2                      // outer block to be repeated twice
	    { q=3                  // inner block to be repeated 3 times
	        1  d-  /8  v=70    // channel 1: play D3 as an 8th note, using mezzo piano
	        0  d   /8  v=70    // channel 0: play D4 and switch to mezzo piano
	        0  -   /8          // play a rest
	        0  d   /8
	        0  eb  /8
	        0  d   /8
	        0  eb  /8
	        *                   // synchronize: bring all channels to the same time
	    }
	    1  d-  /4
	    1  f-  /4
	    1  c-  /4
	    0  d   /8
	    0  -   /8
	    0  d   /8
	    0  eb  /8
	    0  f   /8
	    0  eb  /8
	}

This results in a MIDI sequence like this:

<img src="img/example-score.svg" title="Example Score">

## Example 3

This example uses a guitar picking pattern with several chords. It produces the beginning of "Dust in the wind":

	// use the guitar in channel 0
	INSTRUMENTS
		0  STEEL_GUITAR Guitar
	END
	
	// define some chords
	CHORD cmaj   c-  e- g- c
	CHORD cmaj7  c-  e- g- b-
	CHORD cadd9  c-  e- g- d
	CHORD asus2  a-2 e- a- b-
	CHORD asus4  a-2 e- a- d
	CHORD amin   a-2 e- a- c
	
	// define the picking pattern (Travis picking)
	PATTERN travis
		0,3 /4      // the numbers inside the pattern
		1   /8      // aren't channel numbers
		2   /8      // but note indices
		0   /8
		3   /8
		1   /8
		2   /8
	END
	
	// play the chords using this pattern
	0  cmaj   travis
	0  cmaj7  travis
	0  cadd9  travis
	0  cmaj   travis
	0  asus2  travis
	0  asus4  travis
	0  amin   travis
	0  asus2  travis

This results in the following sequence:

<img src="img/example-dust.svg" title="Example Score">

## Example 4

This example uses functions. It produces the first beats of "Another one bites the Dust":

	INSTRUMENTS
		5  E_BASS_FINGER  Bass
	END
	
	// anacrusis
	* time 1/8
	5 a-2 /16  d=30%
	5 g-2 /16
	
	// regular
	* time 4/4
	CALL drum-and-bass(firstBar)
	CALL drum-and-bass()  q=2
	
	FUNCTION drum-and-bass
		CALL bassline($[0])
		CALL drums
		CALL drums
		CALL drums
		CALL drums
	END
	
	FUNCTION bassline
		5 e-2 /4   q=3, d=30%
		5 -   /8.
		5 e-2 /16
		5 e-2 /8   q=2
		5 g-2 /8
		5 e-2 /16
		5 a-2 /16
		{ if $[0]
			5 -   /4+/8
			5 a-2 /16
			5 g-2 /16
		}
		{ else
			5 -  /2
		}
	END
	
	// p = percussion channel (channel 9)
	// hhc = hi-hat-closed, bd1 = base-drum-1, sd1 = snare-drum-1
	FUNCTION drums
		p hhc,bd1     /8 v=127
		p hhc         /8 v=80
		p hhc,bd1,sd1 /8 v=127
		p hhc         /8 v=80
	END

The resulting sequence looks like this:

# Command Line Interface

By default (without arguments) Midica is started in GUI mode.
But you can provide command line arguments:

```
java -jar midica.jar [ARGUMENTS]
```

You can see all available arguments with `--help`:

```
java -jar midica.jar --help
```

This explains which arguments are available and how they work:

```
ARGUMENTS:
--help                : Print this message.
--cli                 : Run in CLI mode (command line interface) without GUI.
                        Exits after all CLI related work is done.
--keep-alive          : Don't exit, even if --cli has been used.
                        Mainly used for unit tests.
--ignore-local-config : Doesn't use local config file. Use default config.
                        Without this argument the config is read from and
                        written into the file '.midica.conf' in the current
                        user's home directory.
--soundfont=PATH      : Use the specified soundfont file.
--import=PATH         : Import from the specified MidicaPL file.
--import-midi=PATH    : Import from the specified MIDI file.
--import-alda=PATH    : Import from the specified ALDA file by calling the
                        alda program. (ALDA needs to be installed.)
--import-abc=PATH     : Import from the specified ABC file by calling
                        midi2abc. (abcMIDI needs to be installed.)
--import-ly=PATH      : Import from the specified LilyPond file by calling
                        lilypond. (LilyPond needs to be installed.)
--import-mscore=PATH  : Import from the specified file using MuseScore
                        (MuseScore needs to be installed.)
--export-midi=PATH    : Export to the specified MIDI file.
--export=PATH         : Export to the specified MidicaPL file. (*)
--export-alda=PATH    : Export to the specified ALDA file. (*)

(*) A file is exported to STDOUT if the export PATH is a dash (-).
    E.g. --export=-
